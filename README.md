We have designed the carousel functionality of products using javascript as assigning the event listeners to the arrow buttons and containing each product in a different container and put all the products in a container at last and overflow the image and user the attributes like visibility hidden and trigger on the event listeners.

# Address / Payment Page
The address is taken from the user and sent to localStorage so this address could be used further used in the payment page to select from multiple addresses entered. The idea was to make a payment page that is not functional, but the carrier can take the dummy input that the user provides. basically, it was just a dummy Static page with a minimum amount of CSS present.
